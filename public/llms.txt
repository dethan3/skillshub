## About SkillsHub

SkillsHub is a community-driven directory for discovering, sharing, and deploying AI Agent Skills following the open SKILL.md standard. It serves as a central hub for finding reusable AI capabilities that work with Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are reusable, self-contained capabilities that AI assistants can use to accomplish specific tasks. Each skill is defined using the SKILL.md specification - a simple markdown format with YAML frontmatter that describes when and how to use the skill.

Skills are:
- **Modular**: Self-contained capabilities that can be used independently
- **Model-Invoked**: Automatically activated by AI based on context
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Work across different AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- **Community-Driven**: Shared, forked, and improved by the community
